							<h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This project is a Hangman game developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. The game implements several design patterns, such as SOLID, GRASP, and encapsulation, ensuring a well-structured and maintainable codebase. The graphical user interface (GUI) was designed for an interactive and user-friendly experience, providing different levels of difficulty for players.</p>

    <h2>Game Features</h2>
    <p>The Hangman game offers the following key features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Difficulty Levels:</strong> Users can select between <em>Easy Mode</em> and <em>Hard Mode</em> from the homepage. Easy mode offers more lives and simpler words, while Hard mode provides fewer lives and more challenging words.</li>
        <li><strong>Help Section:</strong> A dedicated help option on the homepage provides instructions on how to play the game.</li>
        <li><strong>Word Guessing:</strong> Players are tasked with guessing a hidden word by inputting one letter at a time. If the guessed letter is correct, it appears in the word. If incorrect, the player loses a life and a limb of the hangman appears. The game ends when the player either guesses the entire word or runs out of lives and the entire hangman character is drawn.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Hangman Works</h2>
    <p>In the game of Hangman, a hidden word is represented by blank spaces, and players attempt to guess letters to reveal the word. Each correct letter guessed is revealed in its respective position, while incorrect guesses reduce the number of remaining lives. The objective is to guess the full word before running out of lives.</p>

    <h2>Design Principles</h2>
    <p>This project was built using several key software design principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SOLID:</strong> The game adheres to SOLID principles, ensuring that each class has a single responsibility and that the code is easily extendable and maintainable.</li>
        <li><strong>GRASP:</strong> The General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns (GRASP) were applied to assign clear responsibilities to each class, ensuring a modular and efficient design.</li>
        <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> The internal workings of the gameâ€™s components are hidden from the outside, providing a clean and secure interaction between objects.</li>
    </ul>
